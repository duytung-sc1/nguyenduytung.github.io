## Overview:

This worklog documents my journey through the AWS Cloud Journey internship program, where I completed a comprehensive 12-week learning and hands-on project experience.
The program was structured to progressively build knowledge from fundamental AWS concepts to deploying a complete, production-ready web application architecture on AWS.
